Suddenly, a savage Gootkit4 appears !
====

During a hunting session, a beautiful gift was given to me.

A fully worked Gootkit4 CC with 900 currently actives bots and 100Go of data as cc, ppl creds, ... I wanna write about it and try to fingerprint the cute.

If you're one of the [ppl compromised](ppl.log) :
* Update your AV (Choose Avira or Eset)
* Stop any connection with internet
* Scan immediatelly your computer looking for Gootkit trojan
